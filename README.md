## My process

Again I started building the mobile solution first but I follow a more structured process this time.

- 1 - build html and get required fonts
- 2 - worked on the text part and after on the image
  this point I used <image> and div as layer to make the color effetct.
  Worked well, but when I started the desktop version I noticed the other svg file for desktop version, so I decided to change.
- 3 - after everything was working well I started to check if the project was really working in all resolution at Chrome.
  I rebuild the structure again in an another index.html because the transiction between desktop and mobile was weird.

At the end I conclude that I should build the structure and test the flow between sizes before style the elements inside.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I review 3 conceps that I got stuck during the challenge:

- flexbox, change the order of the elements
- background-blend-mode

I spend again a time to review flexbox and fix more some concepts.

### Continued development

Again I haven't used any library or framework yet, because I want spend more time understanding the properties and how they work. I beleive I will start use them when I finish all newbie challenges.

### Useful resources

Again thanks Kyle for this amazing tutorial about flex-box
